	Exercises:
	1. Write a program that asks the user for their name and greets them with their name.
	
	2. Modify the previous program such that only the users Alice and Bob are greeted with their names.
	
	3. Two inputs, four or 6 arithmetic operations - including modulus and power
		Input first number: 125
		Input second number: 24
		Expected Output :
		125 + 24 = 149
		125 - 24 = 101
		125 x 24 = 3000
		125 / 24 = 5
		125 mod 24 = 5
		
	4. Multiplication table
		Input a number: 8
		Expected Output :
		8 x 1 = 8
		8 x 2 = 16
		8 x 3 = 24
		
	5. sum of first N natural numbers.
	Input number of terms : 10
	The Sum is : 55
	
	6. Modify the previous program such that only multiples of three or five are considered in the sum, e.g. 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15 for n=17
	
	7. Write a program that prints the next 20 leap years.[While loop]
	
	8. Get input N. Read N inputs and print their sum
	Input number of terms : 10
	Input the 10 numbers : 
	Number-1 :2 
	... 
	Number-10 :2 
	The sum of 10 no is : 55 
	
	9. find the sum of the series 1 +11 + 111 + 1111 + .. n terms.
	Input the number of terms : 5 
	1 + 11 + 111 + 1111 + 11111 
	The Sum is : 12345
	
	10. Recursion: Sum to n numbers
	11. Recursion: Fibonacci series up to n
